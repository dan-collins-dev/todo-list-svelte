# Todo App (Svelte)
This mini-project is centered around building a simple todo app. The goal is to build out the app without any front-end frameworks, then rebuild the same project with a front-end framework to learn the basics.

## Note
This repo is for the app built with Svelte. The vanilla todo repos can be found [here](https://github.com/dan-collins-dev/todo-list-vanilla). 

I will be working on these projects in tandem and as I progress in the vanilla version and my understanding of Svelte grows.

## Features
- Mobile-first Design
- Data Persistance via local storage
- Each Todo has CRUD actions
